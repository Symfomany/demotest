3 Principles Type of Test:

- Unit Testing — Unit testing helps to check that individual unit of code (mostly functions) work as expected.

- Integration Tests — Integration tests are tests where individual units/features of the app are combined and tested as a group.

- End-to-End Tests — This test helps to confirm that entire features work from the user’s perspective when using the actual application.
